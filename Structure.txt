STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT:

1) Home Page
   - Catchy image and slogans
   - Great appearance and UI
   - Navbar having all the services ==> (Home, Services, About Us, Contact Us
   - Gallery (in form of boxes) having the information about services we provide
   - Services ==> Crop and fertilizer recommendation system
              ==> Plant disease prediction of common crops
			  ==> Real-Time weather based on the location
   - When we will click on the gallery boxes of services a page should open of that particular service 


2) Crop and fertilizer recommendation system
   - Predictors are N, P, K, temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall
   - Using these predictors, the model will predict the crop to grow for maximum yeild
   - Also, it will suggest to add nutrients and fertilzers based on the N, P, K value
   - Best performing models are Random Forest and XGBoost

3) Disease Prediction
   - Dataset mentioned in references.txt
   - Make a seperate webpage for this
   - Will use AlexNet (pretrained) or custom CNN model
   
4) Real time weather
   - Real time weather information on a seperate page
   - Give some suggestions based on the future weather to farmers
